# RWP Modpack

Hullo, it's EclipticIndustries here! Welcome to the [Runway Project](https://discord.gg/mzAbqvmP) modpack. This modpack is meant to be used in the context of RWP, but feel free to check it out regardless if you're looking for a somewhat tailored aircraft-focused BDArmory experience, with a stock KSP balance.

We've chosen to distribute this modpack as a stand-alone zip file rather than a CKAN archive mostly for simplicity, but also to allow us to be selective in which parts are in included, and to easily integrate customized config. If you're interested in using this modpack as a player, just download `RWP_Modpack.zip`, and copy the `GameData` folder within it into your KSP install.

## ðŸ”§ Developer Instructions

If you want to build on the modpack, or use it as a developer, you'll instead need to clone this git repository (*along with all its submodules!*) with `git checkout --recurse-submodules git@github.com/runway-project/rwp-s6-modpack`. In order to rebuild the mod, first install Node.js, then run `npm install` from the root of the repo to pull down some dependencies. You can then issue a rebuild command by running `npm run build`.

The build script will create a new `dist/RWP_Modpack` directory, along with a versioned zip file containing all the mods.

All the custom content is stored in `src/parts`, and will be automatically copied over by the build script.

### ðŸ’€ A brief word about normal maps in KSP

So, while working on this modpack, I uncovered some cursed knowledge about how KSP's bumped specular shader handles normal maps. Internally, it seems to expect normal maps to be encoded using [DTX5nm compression](http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Normal_Map_Compression#DXT5nm_Compression), where the contents of the normal map's red channel is instead stored in the alpha channel. Using a standard normal map generated by essentially any tool which exists (X in the red channel, Y in the green channel) will result in broken lighting.

Optimally, any normal maps you author would just be encoded as .DDS files with DTX5nm compression, but modern tools (e.g. the Photoshop DDS plugin) seem to output DirectX 10 DDS files, which KSP can't use.

Instead, I've solved this in this modpack by storing the normal maps as 16-bit PNGs, with the red channel manually copied into the alpha. This seems to work, although it's a bit inelegant.
