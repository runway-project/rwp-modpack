	- Add a button (in the Settings->UI section) when in the SPH/VAB to generate missing craft thumbnails (which can be found in KSP/thumbs).
		- Generating thumbnails involves loading each craft and capturing a thumbnail. This can take some time if many are missing.
	- Add "VAB Organizer" MM patch for BDA parts — from user Spartwo.
- AI:
	- Fix AI not going into Ramming mode when guns possess ammo, but not enough to meet resourceRequestAmount of mounted weapons.

	- Add missing sonar checks for AIs trying to fire torpedoes.
	- Fix AI not turning on Active sonar when trying to fire INS torpedoes if no passive sonar on vessel.
	- AI visual detection of incoming missiles within visual range no longer requires a RWR. RWR detection of incoming missiles still requires a RWR on the craft.
	- Tweak AI detection and reaction to incoming GPS/INS missiles, they should detect and react to them a bit more consistantly now.
	- AI can now make use of non-DynamicRadar radars for missile targeting when being actively targeted by incoming anti-radiation ordinance.
	- AI can now do non-linear evasion vs long-range targets while aiming missiles.
	- Add Extend Min Gain Rate slider to set extend abort condition if not gaining distance fast enough.

		- Teams are considered as the per file / per folder option.
		- The "Re-use Craft To Fill Teams" option applies for teams that lack sufficient craft to fill the spawn template.
		- Both shuffled and ranked tournaments are supported.
	- Add a hidden option to "smart assign" teams for custom spawn templates (when not running a tournament).
		- Set "VESSEL_SPAWN_SMART_REASSIGN_TEAMS = True" in BDA's settings.cfg to enable it when "Reassign Teams" is enabled.
		- The first vessel in the spawn template with a non-default team name (can be set in the SPH) that isn't already taken sets the name for the team. Other teams get their default letter.
	- Updated plot_summary.py to adjust how the graph and legend fit in the window.

- Detectors:
	- RWR no longer clamped to visual FOV for detecting incoming missiles.
	- Add new fieldOfView field to RadarWarningReceiver module to set custom RWR FOV.
	- Fix AI not popping countermeasures for non-radar incoming missiles detected by RWR but outside visual range.
	- Added notching and beaming behavior for both vessel radars and missile radars.
		- Defaults to off. When toggled on, radars can be notched by an aircraft flying low and at 90° to the radar.
		- Behavior is configurable using the activeRadarVelocityGate and activeRadarRangeGate floatcurves for missiles and radarVelocityGate and radarRangeGate floatcurves for radars.
		- Also includes water blocking radars, forcing engagements to consider the horizon.
			- Added a hidden "RADAR_ALLOW_SURFACE_WARFARE" option (default: true), which permits surface vessels to see each other over the horizon to simplify naval engagements.
	- Fix the targeting window breaking a lot of scroll behaviours.
	- Fix the targeting window's slewing along an axis and add a small quadratic component to allow faster slewing with faster mouse movement.

	- Fix electrolaser NRE when firing on a target vessel.
	- Added a hidden "WEAPONS_RESPECT_CROSSFEED" setting (default: true), which may be set to false to restore previous behavior where guns did not respect crossfeed rules.
	- Improved performance of bullet firing code.
	- Fixed issue where slaved turrets would fire at a stale radar contact.
	- Added "guidanceRange" parameter for guided bullets, determines the range to the target at which the bullet will begin to maneuver, set to -1 for guidance immediately from the muzzle.
	- Missiles:
		- Add "cruiseRangeTrigger" field to missiles. Missiles using this will delay firing their cruise motor until within the set distance to target.
		- Tweak acoustic propagation loss rate for passive acoustic torpedoes, should have a bit further effective detection range now.
		- Fix INS guidance ordinance not configured with a datalink immediately triggering the lost lock condition and self-destructing.

		- Fixed booster mass missing from missile dV calculation.
		- Fixed terminal radar guidance missiles lacking IFF.
		- Inertial guidance missiles with terminal guidance that were dumbfired will now activate their terminal guidance.
- Armor:
	- Armor should now be more consistent in terms of HE resistance. Adjusting the "Armor Explosion Resistance Multiplier" should now more directly affect the amount of armor penetration explosions do.
	- Improved long-dart armor penetration mechanics, should have improved performance against consecutive plates in contact with each other. Improved residual velocity formula.
	- Implemented "realistic" model for explosive reactive armor against kinetic projectiles, now using an interaction length-based model, supports symmetrical and open-faced sandwich configurations.
		- Hits on the sides of explosive reactive armor now no longer provide additional armor protection. (For Modders: Ensure that the section.forward transform is normal to the strike-face of the ERA. Turning on Debug Lines will show you the forward transforms in blue, the green and red lines represent .right and .up respectively.)
		- Now the specific explosive reactive armor section hit by bullets will explode instead of a random section.
	- Implemented angle correction for explosive reactive armor hits, now penetration increases with increasing hit angle. Resistance described by armorModifier * 300 mm at 68 degrees.
	- HEAT warheads now become unfocused as they penetrate through layers of armor, thicker layers will unfocus HEAT jets more than thinner layers.
	- Added a hidden "HEAT_CONE_HALF_ANGLE" setting (default: 2.5), which allows the damage cone angle for HEAT warheads to be adjusted.
		- Setting this value to -1 makes the HEAT damage area into a line instead of a cone.
	- Added a hidden "KERBAL_ERA" setting (default: true), which can be set to false so that EVA Kerbals no longer provide infinite armor.
	- Adjustable armor now scales breakingForce and breakingTorque based on values in the part.cfg file.
- RWP:
	- For S6R10, GM kill craft that lack propulsion and are significantly beyond the asteroid field radius.
	- Adjust attraction of asteroids beyond 90% of the field radius to not clump together at the centre so that they don't kill the sole surviving craft.
	- Add craft spawn warning message if craft doesn't have AI/WM on root part or if the root part isn't a cockpit.
- P:S:
	- Add max extend time limit clamp to override extend behavior that goes on for longer than time limit.
	- Add support for automated AI/WM settings for competition rules compliance. To utilze, create a 'Comp_settings.cfg' with an 'AIWMChecks' node, containing one or more of the following settings: 
		-	extensionCutoffTime = n
		-	extendDistanceAirToAir = n
		-	MONOCOCKPIT_VIEWRANGE = n
		-	DUALCOCKPIT_VIEWRANGE = n
		-	guardAngle = n
		-	collisionAvoidanceThreshold = n
		-	vesselCollisionAvoidanceLookAheadPeriod = n
		-	vesselCollisionAvoidanceStrength = n
		-	idleSpeed = n
		-	DISABLE_SAS = T/F	
		If the file is not present, or it is, but the Use AI/WM Overrides toggle in Game Modes is off, overrides will not be used. Overrides will apply on competition start or vessel spawn.

	- Add S6R5 dynamic recoil gamemode; recoil scales with vessel thrust.
	- Improved handling of auto-adjusted BDA settings for RWP.
	- Update the RWP specific settings for recent and earlier rounds.
- ModIntegration:
	- Fix the type to unbox MidChordSweep to.

v1.6.11.0
IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- General:
	- Recompile the shaders on an older version of Unity so that they're compatible with KSP v1.9.1 and later.
	- Fix false positives of Krakensbane being active on vessel switches.
	- Add a part Tree Hierarchy visualizer to the BDA Craft Utilities Tool for checking part offset.
- UI:
	- Make the time-scaling slider visible without needing to activate time override.
	- Extend the camera-switch slider to up to 15s.
- AI / WM:
	- Clamp the vertical adjustment of the fly-to position to at most half the distance to the target (should fix the issue of being unable to attack targets directly below).
	- Add a slider for biasing the Immelmann pitch direction when not close to terrain/min altitude.
	- Add a slider for the initial roll-relevance and preserve the best roll-relevance between auto-tuning runs.
- Competition:
	- Add "Parts lost to asteroids" to the continuous spawn tournament score logs and parser.
	- Fix world switching for auto-resuming continuous spawn tournaments.
	- Make the "Auto-Quit On Tournament End" option apply whenever it's visible.
	- Suppress the "Dumping scores..." messages unless competition debugging is enabled.
- Game Modes:
	- Add Gun Game game option to the Mutator GameMode - craft progress through a list of mutators (weapon changes or otherwise) every time they score a kill. Ideally used with Continuous Spawn.
	- Asteroid Field:
		- Adjust the anomalous attraction strengths to scale better with typical asteroid radii.
		- Add an inter-asteroid repulsion at close ranges to prevent asteroids clumping too much.
		- Make the asteroids nigh indestructible so that they don't thin out over time.
- Weapons:
	- Reduce ECPerShot cost of electrolasers.
	- Heatrays now check for part occlusion.
	- Fix non-damaging lasers (gravity guns, etc.) from not scoring in competition.
	- Fix the luminance of tracers on pooled bullets not being reset (not every bullet is a tracer now).
	- Lasers now deal damage to buildings.
	- Missiles:
		- Fix Missile Exhaust FX issue.
- RWP:
	- Add RWP override settings (in RWP_settings.cfg) for automatically enabling/disabling RWP options when the RWP toggle is toggled or the RWP slider is adjusted.
		- Settings adjusted when RWP is enabled aren't saved, but can be manually added to the RWP_settings.cfg file.
		- Settings adjusted when RWP is disabled are saved to settings.cfg as usual and serve as the base that the RWP settings override.
		- Overrides for round 0 are global overrides and are applied first before round specific overrides are applied.
		- Toggling the RWP toggle or moving the slider first reverts settings to the non-RWP values, then applies the global and round-specific RWP overrides.
		- For convenience, a few settings are excluded from being reverted: settings section toggles and most spawn settings. Also, inf fuel / inf EC currently aren't affected.
		- The defaults for the RWP_settings.cfg file will be saved when settings are first saved and changes made to the file override the defaults.
		- Default RWP settings for previous rounds and the upcoming S6R2 have been added.
	- Restrict the RWP slider to only include rounds that have overrides and move it to the top of the section to avoid issues with layout changes while adjusting the slider.

v1.6.10.1
IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- UI:
	- Updated German localisation from EzBro.
	- Fix some localisation tags and duplicates.
- AI / WM:
	- Don't reset PID values to stored auto-tuning ones when switching the clamped/unclamped toggle.

IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- General:
	- Fix Krakensbane adjustments when the active vessel dies.
	- Make sure various pooled objects are disabled when leaving the flight scene.
	- Battle damage fuel leak rates now scale by (bullet caliber)^2, instead of (bullet caliber). Fuel leak rates for 20mm caliber remain the same, calibers higher and lower than 20mm will now have higher and lower leak rates, respectively.
	- Fixes for Kerbal Safety not always detecting EVA kerbals.
- UI:
	- Updated Chinese localization thanks to user Marv1n-M.
	- Fix part filtering by search terms in the editors.
	- Adjust timing and conditions for auto-camera switching to and away from missiles.
	- Fix tracer visuals when the active vessel dies.
	- New Opacity option in BDA Team Icons to set icon opacity.
	- Adds CASE ammo explosion radii visualizer in the editors, enable via F3.
	- Continuous Spawn now shows lives remaining in the Vessel Switcher GUI.
	- Add a UI scaling option for BDA's windows.
	- Improve the logarithmic scaling in the radar windows.
	- Add a 'withZero' parameter to semi-log sliders that allows them to include 0 and uses lower precision for the smallest range.
	- Add a 'GUIUtils.HorizontalSemiLogSlider' for simplifying horizontal sliders for semi-log float ranges outside of PAWs.
	- Add a fractional component to the precision of semi-log sliders for rounding, e.g., sigFig = 1.5f gives '..., 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 15, 20, ...'. Switch the spawn distance slider to use this.
	- Add a power-law float range type and 'GUIUtils.HorizontalPowerSlider' for simplifying horizontal sliders for power-law float ranges outside of PAWs.
- AI / WM:
	- Add new "Kinematic Msl Evasion" toggle to Pilot AI under the evasion settings. When this is enabled the AI will evaluate the best maneuver to defeat a beyond-visual-range (BVR) missile using only kinematic maneuvers. The Time to Impact Before Evade setting on the weapons manager should be set to a high value when this evasion option is enabled. Maneuvers the AI will use are:
		- Crank - Fly at an angle to the target, while still maintaining radar lock.
		- Beam/Notch - Fly perpendicular to the missile.
		- Turn away/Turn cold - Fly away from the missile.
		- Notch & dive - This is the standard AI behavior if this toggle is disabled. It is also used if the toggle is enabled and the AI is within lethal range of the missile.
	- Invert the roll target when the fly-to direction is below and behind the craft within the Immelmann turn angle (fixes death spirals).
	- Fix automatic gun range adjustments in the WM again.
	- Prevent Orbital AI from changing attitude while launched missile is still near spacecraft.
	- Add Smoke CM timing/interval/repetition settings.
	- Fix the missile evasion direction using the wrong reference frame.
	- Automatically disable precision input mode when auto-tuning (KSP's UI element doesn't switch though).
	- Add a slider for prioritizing using brakes to slow down when braking is allowed.
- Armor / Hull:
	- Radar stealth coatings - can now apply radar absorbent/reflective materials on a per-part basis.
		- Armor coatings less than 10mm thick will provide lessened benefits.
	- Adds new radarReflectivity field to Armor materials to specify degree of radar absorbtion/reflectivity of the armor.
	- Adds new radarMod field to Hull materials to set degree of radar return off unarmored parts.
	- Adds new Radar Absorbent Coating armor type.
	- Adds new Radar Absorbent Foam hull material.
- Detectors / Countermeasures:
	- Fix missing resource for the Bubble CM.
	- Fix targeting cameras not being able to track targets.
- Weapons:
	- Corrections to penetration and ricochet velocity changes and ricochet positions.
	- Stop APS firing at dead missiles.
	- 'subProjectileCount' has been deprecated and replaced with 'projectileCount'; this specifies the number of pellets per shot (for shotguns, etc.) to make it more intuitive. Existing shotgun-type weapons will need to update their bulletDefs.
	- The subMunitionType field for beehive ammo now uses the syntax of "ammotype; quantity" (e.g. subMunitionType = 35x228AHEADPellet; 30) with number of projectiles released on detonation set here instead of the subMunition's bulletDef.
		- BDA will try to automatically detect and adjust old beehive ammo types, but mods should update their bulletDefs accordingly.
	- Fix the aiming reticles of guns (fixed and turrets) and auto-proxy-tracking when using MouseAimFlight (again).
	- Add new projectileTTL field to bulletDefs, use to set time in seconds beehive round subprojectiles will persist for. Optional, defaults to 0.5. 
	- Switch the gun range sliders to use a power-law slider instead of a semi-log slider to keep typical ranges closer to the centre of the slider.
	- Missiles:
		- Fix issue with Rotary Rails trying to use missiles that have previously been blown off from combat damage.
		- Fix issue with MultiMissileLauncher Turrets throwing an NRE when AI firing.
		- Fix mass changes of missiles that decouple boosters and add missile mass debug telemetry.
		- Fix radar and heat targeting leading targets excessively (most apparent in orbit).
		- Fix missile drag curve having negative drag at ~25 deg AoA.
		- Fix AI occasionally not firing radar missiles; Git Issue #573.
		- Change target offset on missiles with continous rod warheads from Detonation Distance / 3 to  Min(Blast Radius / 3, Detonation Distance / 3).
		- Fix missile RCS FX constantly displaying.
		- Missiles with RCS/Orbital homing types (i.e. HEKV) in vacuum now perform turn maneuver after launch to face target and only throttle up once facing target.
		- Fixes to anti-missile missile point-defense logic to support missile turret launched interceptors.
		- Fix radar missiles not locking and firing until well within their max engagement range.
		- Add new dragArea configuration variable for missiles to set reference area for drag independently from the lift area. If not set, this defaults to the liftArea setting in the missile configuration file.
		- Fix missiles ignoring guns with priority.
		- Added missile g-limiting. Now you can set a missile maximum g-limit using the "gLimit" field. Additionally a "gMargin" field exists which allows you to specify an allowable margin the missile can miss by to optimize drag. I.e., the missile is allowed to pull only gLimit - gMargin if pulling gLimit will result in too much drag.
		- Corrected pronav and augpronav normal acceleration using the g-limiting feature.
		- Improved missile turning behavior, turns should be slightly smoother overall.
		- Added Kappa guidance, an optimal type of midcourse guidance for in-atmosphere missiles. This re-uses the LoftAngle, LoftMaxAltitude and LoftRangeOverride fields, though LoftRangeOverride is now the range where the missile will switch from lofting to the midcourse guidance. Introduces a new field, "kappaAngle" which is a trajectory shaping angle, higher values mean a steeper terminal trajectory.
		- Fixed missile contact detonation logic, a bug was present which lead to inaccurate detection of missile contact.
		- Improved AAMLoft performance against maneuvering targets.
		- EMP warheads only detonate when armed and no longer do additional damage.
		- Add dumbTerminalGuidance bool (default true) to missiles; setting dumbTerminalGuidance = false will have missiles continue to use primary guidance until terminal targeting mode has a lock, vs immediately switching to terminal guidance the moment the distance trigger is satisfied.
- Competition:
	- Add an option for the continuous spawn central point to follow the centroid of surviving craft (biased back towards the original spawn point).
	- Add an option to automatically resume continuous spawn and to automatically shutdown KSP when continuous spawn ends due to having fewer than 2 craft left.
	- Update the continuous spawn log parser to handle multiple files, either separately or combined, and to only show non-zero columns.
	- Bias the continuous spawn's "bubble shuffle" to prioritise craft with fewer spawns.
	- Hide the ALIVE / DEAD string in continuous spawn when the UI is hidden.
	- Delay spawning craft in continuous spawning while the death cam is active to avoid lag during that shot.
- RWP:
	- Add RWP S6R1 specific overrides.

		- The AI will maneuver at the Maneuver Speed setting and once within gun range try to fire guns while at the Strafe Speed setting.
		- It will evade missiles based on the countermeasure settings on the Weapons Manager and evade gunfire using AI settings similar to those on the Pilot AI.
		- When spawned at orbital altitudes using the BDA Vessel Spawner, craft with the Orbital AI will be automatically spawned into orbit (other options for orbital spawning are cheat menu and HyperEdit mod).
		- Orbital AI is adapted from the StockCombatAI (KCS) mod, check it out here https://github.com/Halbann/StockCombatAI/releases!
	- Base the Immelmann turn pitch direction on the local pitch angular velocity (i.e., pitch down if already rotating that way — fixes the pitch oscillation behaviour when targeting an opponent behind the craft while inverted near terrain).
	- Don't summon the NaN-Kraken when the post-terrain avoidance cool-down is 0.
	- Tightened up 'on target' threshold for dumbfiring missiles.
	- Perform banked turns when the target is behind us at long range and extending is allowed instead of Immelmann turns or turning directly to target. Threshold is clamp(8 * max speed, 1000, 4000).
	- Pilot AI turns will now turn harder (using Max AoA setting) towards the notch direction the closer the missile is to impact.
	- Factor the user-defined steer limit into the turn radius calculations.
	- Use a more gentle take-off slope for the initial take-off.
	- Add an Evasion Min Range Threshold option to only trigger evasion from an attacker using guns when they're beyond that distance.
	- If enemies are detected nearby but beyond gun range and we're not aiming, perform nonlinear (evasive) weaving to avoid long-range sniping.
	- Make the gun range slider more tolerant to following increases in the max gun range.

	- Fixes point defense/APS turrets not engaging incoming missiles.
	- Fix proximity/flak/beehive ammo detonation timing when used in orbit.
	- Missiles:
		- Add new Orbital guidance option for Modular Missiles.
			- Missile will attempt to intercept orbital target at the user-set Max Speed value.
			- homingType = orbital replaces homingType = RCS in missile configuration files (BDA is still backwards-compatible with homingType = RCS).
		- Improvements to modular missile AAM guidance types so that they work in orbit.
		- Fix for HEKV launching unguided in non-ideal situations.
		- Fix clustermissiles launching copies of themselves instead of submunitions.
		- Fix clustermissiles not respecting submunition trigger distance.

- Countermeasures:
	- Add vessel's velocity to chaff ejection particle effect.
	- Use vessel acceleration instead of velocity for chaff decoy factor calculation when in space.
	- Add option in WM's CM settings for auto-deploying CMs when not in guard mode (e.g., for manual combat).
- Vessel Mover / Spawning:
	- Check for outdated loadMeta files when refreshing the craft list in the vessel selection window and update them since KSP doesn't update them when you save your craft!
	- Fix the spawn point selection sometimes not registering.
	- Vessels with an orbital AI that are spawned at safe orbital altitudes are spawned into circular orbits. Vessels are spawned pointing away from each other.
	- Increase maximum spawn distance to 200km.

		- Incorporate missile frontAspectHeatModifier value into missile selection logic so rear-aspect missiles are not selected if they cannot be fired.
- Competition:
	- Include last-damaged-by tracking for bullet explosions that damage vessels, not just hits.

v1.6.4.1
IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- UI:
	- Add an option for disabling the self-updating of the text in numeric input fields.
		- When the value fails to parse (after the delay) the text will turn red.
		- Toggling the numeric fields or closing the windows will reset the field to the most recently successfully parsed value.
		- The text will still be updated if the parsed value becomes clamped within the limits of the field.
	- Make the delay for the "read and interpret" logic of numeric input fields customisable (default 0.5s).

- Countermeasures:
	- Add rcsOverride field to ModuleECMJammer to enable setting craft RCS to a set value.
	- Split CM time into missile evade time and CM deploy time to allow setting a craft to begin evading, then deploy CM, etc.

	- Fix an NRE related to jammers enabling.
- Competition:
	- Make the saving of backup tournaments optional (hidden setting TOURNAMENT_BACKUPS in settings.cfg).
	- Added a ranked tournament mode.
		- Ranked tournaments begin with a single shuffled round (craft assigned to heats randomly), then continues to generate ranked rounds (craft assigned to heats based on their current rank) until the number of ranked rounds run matches or exceeds the rounds slider (which can be adjusted during a tournament).
		- Ranked tournaments only work for FFA style tournaments. nCr and gauntlet style tournaments aren't supported.
		- For teams tournaments, the combined score for the teams is used for the ranking.
		- Enable the score window via the "Sc" button on the Vessel Switcher window.

	- Fix a minor bug in the tournament log parsing script where wins weren't always being counted for the score.
	- Make the saving of backup tournaments optional (hidden setting in settings.cfg).
	- Add NPC support for FFA-RNG tournaments (both ranked and non-ranked).
		- To use NPCs, create a "NPCs" folder in the folder for the tournament (e.g., "AutoSpawn/MyTournament/NPCs"), add the NPC files to this folder, then set the "NPCs Per Heat" slider to the desired number of NPCs.
		- NPC files will be reused as necessary to provide the appropriate number of randomly selected NPCs each heat.
		- When generating heats, the number of NPCs is taken into account for the total number of vessels per heat (e.g., 8 vessels per heat with 2 NPCs per heat would give 6 players + 2 NPCs in each heat).
		- The "Tournament Scores" window will only show the scores for non-NPCs.
	- Add an "auto" setting for the "Vessels Per Team Per Heat" in teams tournaments where the teams will simply be all the craft files in each team's folder.
- Detectors
	- Add settings toggle ASPECTED_RCS that enables real-time RCS evaluation based on the target aircraft's azimuth and elevation relative to the radar evaluating it.
		- Enable from the BDA settings menu under Missile & CM settings: "Real-Time Aspected RCS."
		- The real-time aspected RCS is dependent on a weighted average against overall craft RCS, so lower overall craft RCS will lead to better aspected RCS.
		- Overall craft RCS weighting in this average is dependent on ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT = 0.25 in the settings.cfg file.
		- Final aspected RCS will be = (1-ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT) * [Aspected RCS] + ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT * [Overall RCS].
	- RWRs now activate when they first detect a missile instead of when missile enters visual range.

	- Add try-catch around setting the gear action group due to the FSM sometimes breaking it and breaking pilot initialisation.
	- Remove HP rounding and lower HP limit for MM-patched parts. Apply health modifier after applying rounding and lower HP limit for non-MM-patched parts.
	- Add Infinite Propellant and Infinite Electricity Gamemode toggles to BDA settings menu.
	- Some minor debug message cleanup.
	- Updated German localisation from EzBro.
	- Add Vessel Mover functionality directly in BDA:
		- Spawning:
			- Choice of classic or custom vessel selection:
				- Classic is the built-in vessel selection window (slow to load, but gives more details).
				- Custom is faster and remembers the scroll position.
			- Crew selection (optional):
				- The chosen crew are added to the spawned vessel in the order selected, up to the capacity of the vessel.
				- If the "Fill Seats" option in the Vessel Spawner window is set to "Minimal", then only the selected crew are used, otherwise the remaining crew slots are filled with random kerbals.
				- Option to create or remove kerbals from the roster (excluding Jeb, Val, Bill and Bob).
			- Spawning uses BDA's spawning routines:
				- Corrects for badly sorted part trees in craft files.
				- Mostly fixes staging sequences (some parts, such as parachutes, still don't stage properly).
				- Aligns craft with terrain/scenery normals based on control point orientation and facility the craft was built in.
				- Default spawn orientation matches that of the KSC runway or launchpad, depending on which facility the craft was built in.
		- Moving:
			- Movement and rotation speeds scale with altitude instead of at preset speeds.
			- Movement and rotation have a ramping up period to allow for fine adjustments.
			- Movement automatically maintains altitude AGL but will adjust to avoid buildings and other craft.
			- Movement coordinates are relative to the local coordinate frame with forward aligning with the camera. In map mode, forward is aligned with north.
			- Tab/Shift+Tab jumps to preset altitudes (50km, 10km, 1km, 100m, 10m / minimum safe), 'x' jumps to the minimum safe altitude, other keybinds are the same as for the VesselMover mod (see the help button).
			- Vessels are lowered to the terrain and then eased in for up to 10s to allow them to settle.
			- Vessels can be dropped.
			- Option for setting the minimum lowering speed.
			- Options for enabling brakes/SAS when lowered.
			- Option for placing vessels on terrain below water (also affects terrain following while moving).
			- Option for placement-lowering (jump to safe height, then lower the rest of the way).
			- Option for not worrying about colliding with stuff (for getting really close to things for screenshots).
			- Movement indicator scales with the vessel's radius (+2m).
		- Movement and spawning don't require the active vessel to be landed.
		- Includes a button to recover the active vessel (i.e., remove it) from flight.
		- Doesn't conflict with the VesselMover mod, but actively using both at the same time may cause weird interactions.
		- Limitations:
			- Sometimes, when moving beyond the limits of PRE, KSP can break due to automatic vessel switching.
			- If the mouse is over a window when moving, the camera often lags behind (this is likely due to krakensbane and may be fixable).
			- The camera may act weirdly if CameraTools is enabled while moving a vessel (also likely due to krakensbane).
- UI:
	- Add a keybind for targeting the next GPS target.
	- Add labels to the vessel switcher score entries for rockets, missiles, rams and tag.
	- Parts with zero lift now appear as grey in the lift visualizer.

	- Add option "Camera Switch: Incl. Missiles" to switch to and follow a missile fired by the active vessel until it explodes or misses (requested from FJRT, requires CameraTools v1.27.0 for optimal behaviour).
	- Add whitelist option for guns/rockets/lasers to report hits in the competition marquee.
	- Fix manual aim assist UI placement for fixed weapons.
- AI / WM:
	- AI will start evading missiles once the missile engine activates instead of waiting for 1 second after launch.
	- When orbiting, adjust altitude for terrain variation when below 1000m and account for terrain in the way when below 500m.
	- Remove the 'premature dive fix', which causes weird flight behaviour when flying inverted.
	- Terrain avoidance improvements:
		- When avoiding terrain and roll is inverted by more than the critical angle (default 120°), reverse the roll target so that terrain avoidance is done while fully inverted and enable Aiming steer mode for more yaw control.
		- Remove the terrain avoidance cool-down period for faster recovery after avoiding terrain.
		- Restrict the avoidance radius (default is twice the "radius" of the vessel) to the min altitude to allow cruising at min altitude despite without triggering terrain avoidance.
		- Include all detected colliders in the terrain avoidance path and use a weighted average of normals to determine the appropriate terrain avoidance direction to fly (this helps with avoiding buildings).
		- Remove the secondary raycast for upcoming terrain as it doesn't seem necessary and is doubtful it was helping.
		- Adjust the max deflection for avoiding terrain to be based on the maxAoA clamped to within 45° and 70°.
- Armor / Materials:
	- Steel Hull Material melting point increased.
	- Fix issue with armor panels potentially spalling away more than the entire volume of the plate and getting instantly deleted.

- Competition:
	- Add toggle for setting maxAltitude and GM Kill limits to ASL or AGL.
	- Add Kill timer for GM Altitude to give violators a chance to get back to safe altitude instead of immediate kill.
	- Add customisable fields for the intra-team separation conditions when starting competitions (default: 800m + 100m per member) (FJRT request).
	- Add a per-round PVP score parser.
	- Fix accuracy calcs when using beehive ammo.
	- Fix vessel spawn altitude if RWP slider is set but not the RWP toggle.

	- Rework how damage is applied to buildings and how they regenerate.
	- Add a building damage multiplier.
	- Fix reverse raycasts that were using the wrong rays.
	- Fix detonate direction in BDExplosive part, missiles/rockets with ContinuousRod/ShapedCharge warheads should now have properly oriented AoEs.
	- EMP warheads can now be set to be hard/soft EMP in their configs.
- AI / WM:
	- Add a "Debug Extending" button when AI debugging is enabled that prints extending debug info when clicked if the active vessel is extending.
	- Fix GPS missiles not obeying max missile per target setting when the target is traveling at high speeds.
	- Add an Extend Abort Time slider to the AI, where the AI will abort extending if it fails to gain distance for this amount of time. (Note: this isn't a pure timer; while not gaining distance the timer increases, but will otherwise reduce to 0 at half the rate.)
	- Add a 5s cooldown on extending if the Extend Abort Time is triggered (overriden for various extend requests, e.g., dropping bombs/nukes).
	- Dynamically update the extend distance for launching a missile while extending.
	- Limit the DLZ calculation for the extend distance for firing missiles to being maxOffBoresight off-target - avoids extreme extending distances.
	- Expand the WM's Self-Destruct AG to arm and detonate all explosive parts too.
	- Adjust the smoothing for the AoA and G-load limiting from a moving window (with a ~0.6s delay) to double exponential smoothing (with a ~0.1 delay compensated for by a 0.1s ahead prediction).
		- Note: this doesn't fix AoA/G-load limiting, it just improves the response time of its calculations.
- Detectors:
	- Random position noise due to chaff no longer scales with RCS, is instead fixed to a random number between 16 and 256.
- ECM:
	- ECM Jammer and Cloaking devices now can specify resource used when operating (default is EC).
- Weapons:
	- Fixed bug where the target velocity and acceleration was not being reset once a target was no longer tracked which resulted in lead being erroneously compensated for while mouse aiming.
	- Added ability to manually aim guns using GPS coordinates, primarily for artillery. This behavior is not a functionality in Guard Mode, however when a GPS target is manually selected, turrets will now aim to attempt to hit said target.
	- Improved shaped charge warhead behavior, now armor penetration and beyond-armor effect is much more realistic.
		- Warheads now approximately match real-world penetration performance, given the warhead size and caliber are accurate. Dual-purpose and other multi-function warheads will overperform as the equations assume all of the warhead is a shaped charge. Older and larger warheads may also overperform due to modelling being based on modern warheads.
	- Fixed issue with missile and rocket warheads where direction of blasts were not along the directions of their warheads.
	- Added "caliber" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's an optional field for shaped charge projectiles which influences its effectiveness.
	- apBulletMod now influences shaped charge projectile penetration, modifying this allows for the penetration of shaped charge shells to be tweaked.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's functions the same way as apBulletMod for bullets and its primary purpose is to allow users to create dual-purpose shaped charge warheads, where part of the tntMass of the warhead isn't going into the shaped charge effect, reducing penetration.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to rocket configuration file. This allows tweaking of rocket penetration, functioning the same way as apBulletMod for bullets, affecting physical armor penetration as well as shaped charge armor penetration if the rocket is equipped with a shaped charge warhead.
	- Armor protection against explosions is now influenced by angling, angling armor now makes it more difficult for the blast to punch through the armor plate.
	- Added global setting that allows for tweaking of armor effectiveness against explosion blast penetration. The higher the setting, the harder to damage parts behind armor plates via blast damage.
	- Tweaked several missiles, bullets and rockets to reflect the new shaped charge mechanics:
		- RBS-15 and RBS-15AL have had their warheads decreased from 300 kg to 200 kg to reflect their real counterparts. Added caliber field, set at 500 mm.
		- AGM-114R Hellfire missile has had its warhead decreased from 12 kg to 8 kg, with a 172 mm caliber to reflect performance estimates of earlier known models of the Hellfire. Warhead may not match -114R performance.
		- AGM-65 Maverick missile is set to have a 305 mm caliber and an apMod field added with performance set to 950 mm of penetration. No good estimates of the warhead penetration were found so an approximate estimate based on a 27 kg charge was used.
		- BGM-71 TOW missile has had its warhead decreased from 10 kg to 3.9 kg and has a 152 mm caliber to be around TOW/ITOW performance.
		- Hydra-70 has had its penetration tweaked with apMod to match estimates of the M151 HEDP warhead penetration performance.
		- AGM-86 now has caliber field, set to 620 mm.
		- Adjusted 120 mm HEAT and AP rounds to have around the same amount of penetration, balanced for gameplay (210 mm / 216 mm). Realistic configs also exist under the names "120mmBulletHEAT" and "120mmBulletSabot", a commented out line in m1Abrams.cfg can be uncommented in order to use these.
	- Offset beam-riding missile laser to the right and up from the targeting camera to mitigate issues of the camera locking on to its own missiles when on CoMLock mode, causing the targeting camera to drive missiles into the ground. Mostly affected Guard Mode behavior.
	- Fixed missile behavior with Detonation Distance set to 0, missiles should no longer phase through armor.
	- Reworks ModuleMissileRearm, now works, integrated with WM, etc.
	- Missiles with a ModuleMissileRearm can now have reloads, be affected by Infinite Ammo.
	- Adds MultiMissileLauncher module.
	- Adds new Infinite Ordinance toggle, for missiles with ModuleMissileRearm/MultiMissileLauncher.
	- Fixes NRE with APS missile interception.
	- Inaccurate or multi-shot APS (CIWS rotary cannon, etc) no longer guaranteed to kill incoming projectiles with first shot.
	- Fixes Max Turret Targets not targeting more than 2 vessels.
	- Fix Gravity gun and other impulse/gravitic laser weapons dealing damage.
	- Fix manual rocket turret aiming.
- Armor:
	- Improved hypervelocity projectile post-penetration effects. Now Whipple shields should work properly, the more spacing between the armor plates the better the performance against hypervelocity rounds.
	- Modified behavior of penetration formula below a projectile L/D ratio of 1 so penetration values are more consistent.
	- Re-added temperature effects to armor protection levels, if the armor reaches its max safe temperature or goes above said temperature, performance is degraded.
	- Added new Armor Aluminium material, based on Aluminium 7039 to provide a larger variety of armor materials to select from.
	- Adds Armor Mass Mult slider to allow tweaking armor weight in-game.
	- Armor Type "none" now disabled armor thickness slider, should fix PAW issue with 1.9.1 installs.
	- Armor Tools now displays total wing srf. area, and wingloading kg/m2.
	- Fix Armor tools mass/cost readout giving incorrect values when using global armor type.

		- Add selfsealing options to Monoprop tanks.
		- Tanks using B9PartSwitcher for fuel switching now get selfsealing options.
- AI:
	- Fix incorrect inputField for off-target dynamic roll damping.
	- Fix RippleIndex Errors from weapons overheating/reloading.
	- Fix AI ignoring max missiles per target setting for GPS missiles
	- Spaceborne pilotAIs will now dodge via RCS translation.
	- Craft with guard mode enabled now automatically receive radar contacts via the datalink from friendlies if they have an onboard radar that can receive radar data (canReceiveRadarData = true in part).
	- Corrections to aiming at orbital speeds and long distances (for deep space combat).
		- Caveats:
			- There is a discontinuity in the way KSP handles floating origin/Krakensbane adjustments at 100km above each world that can adversely affect trans-100km orbit aiming slightly (high bullet speeds mostly negates this).
			- KSP won't load surface vessels when the current vessel is over ~90km (on Kerbin) for some unknown reason despite a sufficient PRE range, so orbital bombardment only works from LKO.
			- The targeting reticle currently isn't being correctly placed when manually aiming at closeby targets (will be fixed later).
- Detectors:
	- Fix IRST preventing Radar GUI close.
	- Fix NRE in targeting camera when the camera parent transform is null.
	- Re-work IR occlusion to look at engine and engine plume heat for non-prop engines, weight parts by mass and proximity to heat source for occlusion, and incorporate occlusion from the engine outside of a 50 deg angle of the engine exhaust.
	- Correct spelling of "receive" (and variants) and adjust BDA parts that use "canRecieveRadarData" to use "canReceiveRadarData" instead ("canRecieveRadarData" is retained for compatibility, but other mods should make this adjustment!).
- ECM
	- Radar missile position distortion due to chaff now relies on the ratio of ECM jammer strength to craft signature with RCS reduction to bias the position distortion from chaff to further behind the craft. Net effect is craft with jammers, and especially low RCS craft with jammers, will have an easier time evading radar missiles.
	- Lockbreak from jammers now affects RCS with RCS reduction instead of base RCS. Craft can now mix RCS reduction parts and jammers to break locks without worrying about them conflicting.
	- Incorporate stand-off jamming effects. Friendly craft with jammers now result in your craft being harder to detect and lock. Strength of this effect is determined by the lockBreakerStrength of the friendly jammers, relative distance of friendly jammers (friendly jammers closer to enemy will have a stronger effect), and if the jammers are close in field of view for the enemy (friendly jammers in same field of view will have a stronger effect). Debug readout is available by enabling the Detectors debug option.
	- AI no longer will turn off jammers automatically if they were manually enabled prior to being turned on by the AI.
- Weapons:
	- Fix FXLookAtConstraint modules on various turrets.
	- Fix incorrect charge sound path for lasers.
	- Make the ABL use proper looping audio and add a cool-down sound.

	- Fix for NRE when heatseeker is manually selected prior to activating guard mode.
	- Fix Weapon manager PAW engagement options not affecting AI weapon selection in flight.
	- Missiles and nukes will now properly play their explosion sound effects.
	- AI controlled turrets will no longer return to rest position when overheated/reloading.
	- Fix terminal heat guidance for missiles, including not being decoyed by flares.
	- Improve consistency of anti-radiation distance target check.
	- Add paramater gpsUpdates for GPS guided missiles. gpsUpdates >= 0 in the missile config will allow the missile to get position updates of the target from the craft that launched the missile (if it can still see the target) every gpsUpdates seconds.
	- Corrections to tracer placement and alignment at orbital speeds (for deep space combat).
		- Note: Enable "Vessel-Relative Bullet Checks" when at these speeds for correct collision checks between bullets and vessels. Disable it at lower speeds as it can be a CPU hog.
	- Fix delay/penetrating fuze rounds sometimes not detonating.
	- Penetrating rounds now register damage to all parts they hit, not just first.
	- Fix 'Weapon requires EC' message spam if active vessel is not the one with the weapon in question.
	- Weapons using ECPerShot now only drain ElectricCharge if the vessel has sufficient EC to fire the weapon.
	- Use the explosion models and sounds given in MissileLauncher if none are specified in BDAExplosivePart.
	- Adds Active Protection System implementation.
		- Adds new fields: 'isAPS = T/F', 'APSType = [ballistic, missile,omni]'.
		- Adds new Settings.cfg field 'APS_THRESHOLD = n' to set threshold bullet/rocket size for interception.
- Armor:
	- Adjusted post-penetration behavior of high velocity rounds, rounds now erode instead of slowing down at high velocities.
		- Multi-plate armor schemes now behave more realistically and will require more careful material selection and configuration.
		- Whipple shields for hypervelocity rounds are now viable and desirable. This behavior is however still very crude and does not qualitative match realistic behavior.
	- Adjusted stats for S-Glass and Kevlar materials to have realistic RHA equivalency.
		- Re-implemented Tate-Alekseevksy equation for low-ductility materials.
	- Added debug console output for armor penetration behavior. Now when Debug -> Armor is on, console will output armor penetration parameters.

- AI:
	- Allow a vessel that's lost parts after launch to still be auto-tuned.
	- Don't reset the assigned fly-to position when arriving at an orbiting point so that planes actually orbit the targeted point.
	- Resume various pilot commands if interrupted once the cause of the interruption is removed.

		- [S] - Camera will autoswitch to vessel with highest score.
		- [D] - Camera will switch to furthest vessel from dogfight centroid.
	- Restore the precision of Vector2d persistent fields.

	- Add a config option for the maximum time scaling.
	- Add a new logarithmic float range PAW slider type.

	- Add a check for requested extending already being satisfied.
	- Add terrain awareness to the pilot AI's waypoint fly-to direction.
	- Add a 'Waypoint Terrain Avoidance' slider to the pilot AI to control the range and strength of the waypoint terrain avoidance reaction.

	- Fix AI takeoff behavior.
	- Add Store/Restore option to save control surface configs in Pilot AI.
	- Add extend angle to AI to clamp climb/dive angle when doing Air-to-air extending.
	- Add Air/Ground target preference weighting to Target Priorities.
	- Make the extend toggle apply to air-to-air missiles as well as air-to-air guns.
	- Update the AI GUI help text for the current extending settings.
	- Make the AI GUI vertically resizable.
	- AI will now head to target's last known position if contact lost (out of sight range/angle/radar detection), with accuracy of predicted position decaying over time.
	- AI will now enable radars when guard mode enabled.
	- Add an altitude steer limiter to the pilot AI.
	- Apply user-defined steer limiters to roll.
	- Force VTOL AI to aim towards targets when trying to fire missiles (if it can't already fire the missile).
	- Add a PID auto-tuning mode:
		- The AI will use gradient descent to optimize the plane's ability to turn to a range of headings and stabilize in those directions.
		- The loss being minimized is ∫f(x,θ)dθ over the range θ ∈ (30°,120°) (using the midpoint Riemann sum), where f(x,θ) is ∫(δp²·(α+t²)/θ² + γ·δr²·(α+t)/100/θ)dt for the current PID values (x) and heading change (θ), where δp is the pointing error, δr is the roll error, α is the fast response relevance and γ is the roll relevance (which is automatically adjusted over time to balance the contribution from the pointing and roll errors).
		- Usage: Once the plane is airborne (and not in combat), enable auto-tuning and set the sliders to the desired values (the defaults are reasonable starting points and can be preset in the SPH; adjusting some of the sliders will restart the auto-tuning), then allow the auto-tuning to run until it stops automatically when the learning rate (LR) decreases to below 1e-3. The PID values will revert to those giving the lowest loss and these will be stored so they can be restored in the SPH.
		- Recommendations:
			1. Set the auto-tuning altitude and speed to those expected to be used in combat.
			2. Use 5-10x time-scaling.
			3. Avoid mountainous terrain.
			4. Tune without dynamic damping first and use the result as the starting point for dynamic damping with all the damping values set to the tuned static damping value and the dynamic damping factors set to 1.
			5. Since the PID values are (currently) being optimized for flying to fixed points, the tuned I value may not be optimal for moving targets in combat and a slightly larger I may be desirable.

	- Add Lift Visualization, Total Lift, and Wing Loading readouts (stock only, disabled when using FAR) to the BDA Armor Tool.

- Detectors
	- Adds IRST implementation for thermal detection alternative to radar.

IMPROVEMENTS
- Adds localization for various parts.
- Adds Deployable Missile Rail demo part.

IMPROVEMENTS
- General:
	- Add Waterfall config for the Saturn engine.
	- Increase the HP of the combat seat to the same as a kerbal (500).
	- Add a time scaling option to the GamePlay section of the settings for speeding up/slowing down the game rate while competitions are active.
		- This does not affect the physics time-step, which remains at 0.02, but simply tries to make the in-game clock go faster with respect to a wall clock, so it should not affect the physics (if they're implemented correctly).
		- WARNING: This is likely to mess with any other mod that adjusts the time rate, e.g., TimeControl, if they're active at the same time.
		- WARNING: Consistency of the results (compared to running at normal speed) is not yet verified, but initial results look promising.
- Internal:
	- Add the script for evaluating the score weights and the old dmg_analysis (for .50cal, 20mm and 30mm ammo) to '_Other Stuff'.
	- Remove executable status of the vessel-trace plotting script.

	- Move the main competition update loop (death checks, etc.) to be run consistently from the physics updates instead of from the rendering updates to remove results bias due to computer performance when PHYSICS_FRAME_DT_LIMIT is large.
- AI:
	- Tweaks to VacuumAI terrain avoidance.
	- Add the off-by-one frame fix to ramming and missile guidance.
	- Add logic for planes in Follow mode for the period between taking off and reaching their min altitude.
	- Add unclamped values for the low- and high-speed steer limiters.
- Weapons:
	- Move finalFire checks into a single function that runs in AimAndFire during the FashionablyLate timing phase instead of being spread between Update and FixedUpdate.
	- Add check to AI when using a weapons group to grab the lead offset from a weapon that can fire (has ammo/not reloading/overheated/pointing at self), not merely the first weapon found.
	- Reduce spin up times for Vulcan/Gaus.
	- Fix shrapnel radius of missiles/bombs/shells using standard warheads.
	- Add support for multiple laserbeamFX textures.
	- Add DeployableRail module for missilebays.
	- Explosions from impact-fuzed HE bullets now properly bypass armor when calculating damage to the hit part.

		- The integral is no longer reset to 0 when the pitch error changes sign, nor decays with time.
		- The integral is now vector valued to account for coupling between the yaw and pitch axes due to roll and the individual pitch and yaw components are projected out from this integral.
		- The maximum contribution to the steering from the integral component is 1 (similar to the magnitude of the individual components before this change, but larger than the original 0.2 prior to the previous change).
		- The internal yaw damping factor is increased from 0.2 to 0.33 to keep the internal ratios between the axes consistent for each of the P, I and D components (1:0.33:0.1 for pitch:yaw:roll).
	- Use missile velocity vector for evasion instead of missile relative position to prevent turning into missiles when they are at close range. 
	- Use soonest time to closest approach instead of closest distance to select highest threat missile. 
	- Change closest approach point to ignore missile threats to 3 Blast Radius from 1.5 Blast Radius.

		- Simplify entry conditions for missile evasion behavior (only occurs within threshold of when your craft is set to dispense chaff/flares regardless of whether it has chaff or flares onboard).
		- Proper throttle settings for chaffing vs flaring.
		- Add check if radar missiles are still boresighted towards craft as a condition to treat missiles as a threat.
	- Shift 'AimAndFireAtEndOfFrame' to occur during the FashionablyLate timing phase of FixedUpdate and rename it 'AimAndFire'. This synchronises firing with the physics instead of waiting until the scene is rendered. It also occurs before Krakensbane adjustments have been made.

			- graviticWeapon = foo //gun/laser will temporarily modify mass of hit part
			- massAdjustment = n //mass, in tons, added per sec by beams or per hit by bullets/rockets/pulselasers
		- Adds some new rocketdef config options
			- gravitic = foo //rocket will temporarily modify weight of parts hit by rocket and its explosion
			- impulse = foo //rocket applies non-damaging impulse to parts hit by rocket/explosion
			- choker = foo //rocket will temporarily disable air intakes caught in its blast radius
			- EMP = foo //rocket will apply EMP buildup to targets within blast radius

	- Detect exit collision with objects when the barrel of the gun is within the object's collider, i.e., sub-point-blank shots.
	- Added a slider for configuration of specific RWP rounds.
	- Adjust parsing scripts for updated logging tags format. Add slider for setting the length of time of the death camera.
	- Standardise the format of debug log messages to '[BDArmory.ModuleName']: ...
	- Reload anim support

v1.4.2.7
FIXES

v1.4.2.6
FIXES
	- Fix bug in loading spawn locations on fresh installs.
	- Give vessel spawning more than 5 frames to wait for the reference transforms.
	- Add checks in various parts of the code to avoid potentially applying forces to physicsless parts.

v1.4.2.5
FIXES
	- Wait for reference transforms to be assigned during spawning to avoid NREs.
	- Tweak auto number of vessels for FFA with only a few craft.
	- Fix a variety of NREs in the nuclear engine code.
	- Avoid applying forces to physicsless parts (no rigid body), which removes the need for try..catch block. Clean up code.
	- Track last valid atmDensity of nuclear engine to ensure correct value while vessel being destroyed.
	- Use the approximate GetArea function instead of the radiative area if the radiative area is not available.
	- Clean up formulas for blast impulse. Only apply damage/impulse to each part once per explosion.

v1.4.2.4
FIXES
	- Fix various NREs.
	- Remove null-coalescing operators from Monobehaviours as they don't work in Unity.
	- Multi-Target barrage fix: weapons targeting a target outside their fire arc will now be skipped instead of bringing the barrage to a halt until the offending weapon can be brought to bear.

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Added a few more interesting spawning points (currently requires removing the old spawn_locations.cfg file in order to update, this will be changed soon).
	- Re-work rocket damage to do kinetic damage and penetrate armour and correctly report scoring info.
	- Shared bullet/rocket code moved to Misc.ProjectileUtils.cs.
	- Weapon priority adjustments:
		- Guns targeting ground will now prioritize biggest impact (bullet mass * velocity) instead of tntmass.
		- Guns targeting air will now prioritize RPM for fighter-sized targets, and prioritize larger caliber guns when targeting larger targets (bombers/zeppelins/Ace Combat superweapons).

	- Small optimisation in explosion book-keeping.
	- Increase maximum firing angle to 4 in both the weapon and the weapon manager.

	Kerbal Safety:

	- Remove the kerbals' jetpacks to save 45kg.

	Parsing script:
	- Add default interpreter (for Linux) to parsing script.
	- Default to looking for the latest tournament folder.
	- Rearrange display order so that the 'Score' column is first after the 'Name' column
	- Fix check for default team names in summary
	- Only print teams summary if it's not 'A', 'B', ... as those aren't consistent.
	- Update formatting of tournament parser output to console for consistent column spacing.
	- Add various options to tournament parsing script (run with -h flag for help).
		-q Don't print results summary to console. (default: False)

	- Disable (missing) legacy code analysis tools in .csproj.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Explosive damage penetration:
		- Basic explosive damage penetration handling. Parts closer to the explosion are ablated first with a small amount of bleed through for relatively weak parts.
		- Add comment on original BDA methodology source. Calculate positive phase time based on source method equations. Correct CalculateIncidentImpulse not bounding scaledDistance
	- Remote orchestration:
		- Add slider for inter-heat delay for remote orchestration. Also, doesn't rely on RWP option being enabled now.

	- Pilot AI:
		- Enable storing and restoring settings (keyed by vessel name) for tuning a vessel in-flight and setting those settings in the SPH.
	- Weapon manager / weapon configuration:
		- Rename Target Acceleration to Target TWR since that's what it is
		- Change firing angle to scale with distance and size of target.
			- Include maxDeviation/2 from the weapon in the firing angle calculation to allow more firing at longer range for spray-and-pray guns. Increase max firing angle to 3.
			- Prioritize weapons that are within their firing angle.
			- Adjust weapon prioritisation of being within firing angle for firing angle scaling with target size and distance.
		- Added VIPs, which allow you to set up behavior such as guarding your VIP, or attacking enemy VIPs and ignoring craft defending them.
			- Add new "Is VIP" toggle to the weapons manager. Allows you to set a craft as a "VIP" which opens up new target priority options.
			- Added new target priority options "Protect My VIPs" and "Attack Enemy VIPs". Setting positive values on these sliders will result in the craft targeting enemies that are targeting VIPs on its own team, or attacking enemy VIPs, respectively.
		- Don't try to engage torpedoes with guns/missiles/lasers.
		- Use other weapons for ground targets if missiles fired is greater than or equal to max missiles on target setting.
		- Don't use arc length calculation for torpedo DLZ since they can turn much more quickly in water than airborne missiles.

v1.4.1
FIXES
	- Fix missile hit attribution from missiles without BDExplosivePart modules.
	- Don't include negative thrust percentage drives (Danny2462 drives) in max acceleration calculation as they don't contribute to the thrust.
	- Fix BDRotaryRail stack overflow and give warning if the conditions that gave rise to it occur again.
	- Put chute into right state before deploying it with WM AG.
	- Don't assign gender to spawned kerbals, let KSP do it.
	- Fix CheckSafeToFireGuns for debris preventing firing due to being too close to the target.
	- Reduced (but not eliminated) exceptions due to comet vessels.
	- Change the minimum damage amount of 0.01 to 0 as this was the cause of the fire damage over time applying despite the game being paused or slowed with time control.
	- Fix NREs in explosions from ClusterBomb.cs
	- Add KSP version dependent checks for part.IsKerbalEVA and crew.ResetInventory.
	- Updates Rocket targeting, fixes aimer alignment
	- Updates laser Infos with proper resource usage
IMPROVEMENTS
	UI and quality-of-life tweaks:
	- Add fault tolerance for missing bullet defs in GetInfo.
	- Add similar handing of missing or broken rocket info as for bullet info.
	- Move ConfigNode functions to their own translation unit.
	- Add 'Clear Debris Now' and 'Clear Bystanders Now' buttons to the Vessel Spawner window (in Spawn Options).
	- Option for using the old format of the Vessel Switcher window ('t'). Option for reassigning teams on spawn or retaining the original team name defined in the SPH. Right clicking 'T' in the Vessel Switcher window resets vessels to their original teams. Spawning from 'Folders' assigns the folder as the team name if team reassignment is enabled.
	- Remember position of RWR, Radar and TargetingCamera windows.
	- Add optional extra parameter to CreateExplosion to specify the weapon name (to be used for in-game messages for missile strikes).

	- Speed Adjusted Steer Limiter
	Spawning and Tournaments:
	- Teams options in the spawning and local tournament settings, including custom serialisation (doesn't support commas in craft file names) and UI adjustments.
	- Configure how seats are filled in the Vessel Spawner Window: minimal, all control points, also cabins. Crewed weapons always get filled with 1 crew.
	- Option to reset maxHitPoints on vessels loaded into flight mode (e.g., during spawning). Uses the MM patched value if available.
	- More consistent addition of _1, _2, etc., to vessel names which should make teams of the same vessel have valid results summaries in many cases without having to rename each craft (which is still a better solution!), not just the files.
	- Add RESULT line to competition log to indicate overall result of the competition (needed for teams).
	- Updated format of log files for teams. Updated tournament parsing script.
	- Add break-down of deaths (clean Bullets, clean Missiles, clean Rams, Assists, Suicides) and kills (Bullets, Missiles, Rams), and normalised death order and death time to the results summary.
	- Set KSP version of SpawnProbe to 1.9.0 to avoid issues with spawning on older installations.

	- Free-falling kerbals deploy parachutes.
	- Kerbals in falling command seats leave the seat.
	- Vessels (and kerbals therein) are recovered during spawning instead of getting destroyed.
	- Surviving kerbals are recovered and immediately available for flying in the next competition instead of being MIA.
	- Ejection from cockpits is still a WIP.

	- Battle damage is now configurable with multiple sub-categories, with the following toggles. Per-hit proc chance is also adjustable.
	- Fuel Tanks
		- FuelTanks will now leak when hit
		- Tanks may be configured to be self-sealing, trading some fuel capacity for leak resistance
		- Tank leak rate and leak duration can be adjusted
	- Ammo Boxes
		- Ammo boxes will potentially explode if hit
		- Ammo Boxes can be set to explode when destroyed
		- Adds ModuleCASE to ammo parts. Caselevel can be set from 0-2, higher levels reduce ammo explosion damage, at the cost of increased mass and cost.
	- Engines
		- Engine thrust reduced when hit, will start leaking fuel/catch fire/shut down when badly damaged
		- Intakes performance reduced when hit
		- Engine Gimbals can fail when hit
	- Wings
		- Wing damage per hit reduced
		- Wing lift loss capped at 50% total lift
		- Wing damage per hit is now configurable
		- Ailerons can fail when hit
	- Subsystems
		- Subsystem components
		- SAS/Radar/etc can be disabled when hit
	- Command
		- Control damage when hit
		- Pilots can be killed from cockpit damage
	- Fires - if a tank is leaking fuel, chance for leak to ignite
		- Fire damage over time
		- Fires in cockpits or other crewed or crew adjacent parts will be automatically extinguished.
		- Adds ModuleSelfSealingTank, can be toggled to prevent tanks leaks until tank receives substantial damage. it also adds the ability to configure fueltanks and engines to carry firebottles to extinguish fires
	RCS:
	- Improved RCS calculation accuracy and speed, your craft's RCS may be slightly different from 1.4.0.7
	- Recalculate RCS occasionally when parts are lost (to account for damage or missiles firing)
	- Fix engine afterburner textures affecting RCS calculation (was an issue for Tiger and Cheetah engines from AirplanePlus)
	Missiles:
	- New variables that affect heat seeking missile performance: lockedSeekerFOVBias, and lockedSeekerVelocityBias. See Sidewinder config file for more details.
	- Fixed allAspect and maxOffBoresight to work as intended. Vertical launch systems (VLS) and high off-boresight missiles should work as intended. See AIM-120 config file for details.
	- Add ability for Air-to-Ground missiles to lead targets based on their velocity.
	- Fixed Dynamic Launch Zone calculation, should result in more close-range missile fires and high off-boresight missiles only firing when they are likely to hit their target.
	- Better explanation of what missile parameters do added to Sidewinder and AIM-120 config files (new heat seeker value description in Sidewinder config file).
	- Updated torpedo tuning from Kurgan.
	Target Priority:
	- Target acceleration target priority now returns TWR/10 instead of instantaneous acceleration/10. Is set to -1 when target craft loses engines.
	- Less teammates engaging target priority now returns -1 when all teammates are engaging the same target instead of 0 (allows for better ganging up on the same target).
	Parts:
	- New armor panels, rescaled armor panel part mass, cost, HP to scale properly based on size.
	- Remove AIM-4 missiles, are moved to the Flying Circus mod for now, planned to be re-released in a future BDA expansion mod.
	- Added new Typhoon engine to fill the gap between Juno and Panther.
	Effects:
	- New FireFX effect

v1.4.0.5
FIXES
	- Fix craft being able to fire radar missiles at a target they could not lock when another target they could lock was nearby. This usually happened when the target launched missiles, since missiles have a 999 m^2 RCS by default.

v1.4.0.4
FIXES
	- Bugfixes for rocket turrets.
	- Bugfix for Oerlikon bulletType.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Tweaks to fire angle:

	- Improvements to RCS/stealth/ECM:
		- Craft with a lower modified radar signature (from ECM Modules that reduce signature) no longer have increased lock range. The range at which craft are locked will be accurate based on the RCS Window in the SPH/VAB if no jammers are used.
		- Re-worked RCS system. Calculate 95 azimuth/elevation pairs across 0-180 deg Az, 23 to -23 deg El, take the 3rd quartile of the distribution to use as the total RCS.
		- Scale RCS up by 4 to better match reality and provide better balancing against stock radars.
		- Display worst three Az/El pairs in the BDA editor window so that users can improve their design.
		- Fix to turn on all ECM jammers when an incoming radar-missile is detected.
	- Improvements to missiles:
		- Allow firing multiple missiles at the same radar target without losing radar lock. Firing missiles at multiple locked targets needs considerable work to be feasible.
		- Fix known issues with terminal guidance.
		- Add option for configuring FireFOV of a turret (fires when pointing within this angle of target). Reduce step size of fire interval to 0.5s.
	- Improvements to pilot AI:
		- Allow users to set "Firing Angle," the angle the weapons are within of being on target before firing. Default is 1 deg. Setting is on Weapons Manager. Setting only affects weapons with a yaw and pitch range of less than 5 degrees for both axes.
		- Make wing commander 'spread' and 'lag' values persistent.
		- Allow pilots in the "Attack" command to evade if they are being fired at by another craft
		- Sliders for controlling threshold and period of collision avoidance between vessels.
		- Allow craft to evade if they are under attack while being commanded to "Attack."
	- UI improvements:
		- Improved behaviour for entering spawn coordinates and altitude.
		- Add a slider in tournament settings to control delay between heats.
	- Other improvements:
		- Further balancing of the 30mm tnt mass to 0.077 (from 0.081).

	- Remove surface attachment option from combat seat.
	- Add option to automatically kill off WMs after 5s when they become uncontrolled.
	- Kerbals in falling combat seats eject to safety.
	- Deploy halo chute for falling kerbals. Add AG to WM to deploy chutes on external kerbals.

v1.3.8.1
FIXES
	- Report death time to web orchestration in seconds instead of minutes

	- Autonomous combat seats: when disabled (default) during competitions, combat/command seats disable the AI when the kerbal leaves the seat and vessels that are comprised of only a single combat/command seat explode.
	- Reduce max fireBurstLength to 10 and stepIncrement to 0.05 to allow more control of gun burst length.
	- Updated HP patch from CeruleanEyes

v1.3.8
FIXES
	Main fixes:

		- Explosions are no longer limited to 5 at a time.
		- Fixed decals not being returned to the object pool so that they work efficiently now.
	Other fixes:
		- Use the correct spawn distance value in the remote orchestration.
		- Unity's fake nulls strike again: properly reset explosion object pools on scene changes.
		- KSP is labelling some missiles as debris. Detect these and don't remove them.
		- Bugfixes, memory leak fixes and optimisations.
		- Don't use Parallel.ForEach to update ramming information as Unity doesn't like get_transform being called from threads.
		- Assign font attributes in Awake instead of Constructor.
		- Fix potential NRE in ApplyDamage in PooledBullet.cs
		- Fix a potential NRE in continuous spawning where a spawned vessel gets destroyed before it's activated.
		- Fix special case of vessels with combat seats getting renamed.
		- Reset spawn position and rotation after spawning as sometimes KSP packs and unpacks craft and resets things!
		- Wait an extra update during spawning to allow reference transforms to be assigned.
		- Use altitudes from FlightGlobals when raycasting fails during spawning.
IMPROVEMENTS
	Main improvements:
		- Rebalance of explosion damage from bullets to approximate the previous DPS of the browning, vulcan and gau-8.
		- AI/WM now cost 0.
	Other improvements:
		- Remove the '5' from the options for heat size in the automatic vessels per heat optimisation to ensure a minimum heat size of 5.
		- Add configurable keybindings for tournament setup and running. Improve layout of 'Edit Inputs' window.
		- Added an 'auto-enable vessel-switching' option to general settings. Added 'auto' mode for tournament generation that chooses an appropriate number of vessels per heat and distributes the deficit over multiple heats.
		- Set up paintball decal pools when the paintball toggle is toggled.
		- Extra damage sliders in-game
		- Small optimisation to avoid reallocating Ray instance in PooledBullet.cs
		- Add the explModelPath to the browninganm2.cfg
		- Use a split slider for tournament rounds setting to allow up to 100 rounds.
		- Reuse deathOrder variable instead of fetching it from BDACompetitionMode.Instance again.
		- Use minSpeed instead of idleSpeed in steer limiter. Scale possibleAccel by 1/15 as before (but without G) for now until we find a better solution.
		- Additional regular check for vessels renamed as planes due to the combat seat.
		- Automatically end a continuous spawning competition when there's nothing left to spawn and <2 active craft.
		- Add a max altitude GM killer.
		- Updated Python scripts for parsing competition results logs.
		- Also trigger competition end when there's only 1 team left.
		- Include engine acceleration but not gravity in GetSteerLimiterForSpeedAndPower as it makes gliders and RegainEnergy work better.
		- Use afterburners when regaining energy.
		- Trigger the target scan after all the teams have been assigned.
		- Enable target priority by default.
		- Stop extending when changing targets.
		- Include death time and normalised death order in web orchestration reporting with surviving player death order/time set to max

	- Fixes AI not using Torpedos
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Local tournament mode (in the Vessel Spawner window).
	- Re-worked debris/bystander removal.
	- Sliders (in general settings) for many competition timers (such as the killer GM and various grace periods).

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Use aiming mode for steering when within 8s of ramming target.
	- Add in easing factors for ramming, correct missing negative term, use ramming vessel acceleration instead of relative acceleration.
	- Improved lead-time calculations for missile guidance with ease-in factors.
	- Enable target lock for missiles with weapon managers to prevent re-targeting issues.
	- Add 1f to sum of priorities to help with target bias.

v1.3.6.4
FIXES
	- Various

	- Save settings when closing the Vessel Spawner window.
	- Set target spawn location on using 'interesting' buttons.
	- Add a countdown slider for the Round 3 GUI and set the default target geoCoords to 1°N (equivalent to around 11 km).
	- Re-enable detonation of armed explosive parts when they are destroyed.
	- Use partHit position instead of vessel.CoM in proximity calculations. Estimate distance on next fixed update and detonate if expected to collide next fixed update.
	- Use time to closest point of approach for AAM guidance.
	- Use new Saturn texture created by Stardust

v1.3.6.3
FIXES
	- Don't autodestruct missiles if the explosive parts are using the override.
	- Show message about why the vessel spawning timed out.
	- Prevent windows from being competely off-screen (the drag region may still be off-screen though). Toggling "Strict Window Boundaries" will bring all the windows onto the screen if you can't find them.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Absolute Distance vs Distance Factor toggle and expanded Spawn Distance slider for ranges up to 20km. (Note: for distances over 10km, it struggles due to the PRE and terrain. Using an airborne spawn first can help fix this.)

v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
	- New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
	   + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
	   + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
	- Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
	   + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
	- New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
	- New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
	   + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
	   + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
	- Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
	- Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
	- Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
	- A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
	- By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
	- Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
	- Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
	- Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)

= New features=
- Modular Missile Guidance: 
	- New option to detonate an stage on proximity.

v0.2.1.0
= Fixes =
- Problem with display of trajectories/smoke of missiles #74.
- Warhead and Procedural High Explosive cannot be detonated via Action Group #162.
- AI Pilot is unable to use Rapiers in Air Breathing mode if landed #102.
- Fixing modular missile detonation when switching.
- Fixing max static launch range for modular missiles.

v0.2.0.0
= New features=
- Modular Missile Guidance:
	A full rewrite of this part has been done. Now you can build your own missiles, define all its parameters,
	even its name. And it will be used by the AI as if it was a stock BDArmory missile!

	If you want to know more about this new feature, you can download a custom part pack for procedural missiles:
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts
	And read this wiki
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts/wiki/1.-Building-your-first-Modular-Missile

- Proximity Fuse for Missiles: 
	A new field called "detonation distance override" has been added to missiles.
	0 by default means that it will detonate within is normal explosive radius (eg: 20 meters for AIM-120)

- Small High Explosive Warhead can now be rescaled with TweakScale. Git issue #106


= Changes =
- BDALoadedVesselSwitcher has been integrated into BDArmory, it will not be a separate mod anymore.
	Please delete it before installing this version.
- Physics range field and logic has been removed:
	BDArmory now integrates a new mod called PhysicsRangeExtender. https://github.com/jrodrigv/PhysicsRangeExtender
	Now the physics range has been extended to almost 200 km. 
	However, be careful with landed vessels. Even if the vessel still loaded it could be possible that the terrain beneath it's not there anymore.
