    description = Procedural control surface you can shape in any way you want using the context menu. Press J while pointing at this part to open the editor window allowing you to edit the shape and materials of this part. You can exit the editing mode by switching to editing of another part in the very same way, or by pressing J again, or by closing the window. The window can also be opened and closed using the B9 button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
